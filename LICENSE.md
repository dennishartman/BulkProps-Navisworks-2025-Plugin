# Purpose

This license lets you use and alter this software for free.  You have to contribute changes, additions, and other software that builds on this software back on similar terms.

# Agreement

In order to receive this license, you must agree to its rules.  The rules of this license are both obligations under that agreement and conditions to your license.  You must not do anything with this software that triggers a rule that you cannot or will not follow.

# Copyright

The licensor licenses you to do everything with this software that would otherwise infringe their copyright in it. However, you may only distribute the software according to [Distribution](#distribution).

# Distribution

The licensor licenses you to distribute copies of the software within your organisation or institution, and to distribute copies of the software along with your [Prototypes](#prototypes) or [Applications](#applications) that require contribution under the [Copyleft](#copyleft) rules.  You are not permitted to distribute the software with your [Applications](#applications) that are exempt from the [Copyleft](#copyleft) rules.

# Notices

You must ensure that everyone who gets a copy of any part of this software from you, with or without changes, also gets the text of this license.

# Copyleft

With two exceptions, [Prototypes](#prototypes) and [Applications](#applications), you must contribute all changes and additions you make to this software, as well as all software that invokes this software's functionality.  When in doubt, you should contribute.

# Prototypes

You do not have to contribute any change, addition, or other software that meets all these criteria:

1.  You do not use it for production.

2.  You do not share it outside the team developing it, other than for non-production user testing.

3.  You do not use it on behalf of anyone outside the team developing it.

# Applications

You do not have to contribute any software that only invokes this software's functionality through the interfaces this software exposes, unless it exposes so much of this software's interfaces or functionality to users, programmers, or other software that it becomes a practical substitute for this software for any substantial portion of its use cases.  Interfaces exposed by this software include all the interfaces this software provides users, programmers, or other software to invoke its functionality, such as command line, graphical, application programming, remote procedure call, and inter-process communication interfaces.

# Contribute

To contribute software:

1.  Publish all source code for the software in the preferred form for making changes through a freely accessible distribution system widely used for similar source code, so other contributors and users can find and copy it.

2.  Make sure every part of the source code is available under this license, the Blue Oak Model License 1.0.0, or terms with substantially the same legal effect.  You can include source code licensed by others under the MIT License, two-clause BSD License, BSD-2-Clause Plus Patent License, Apache License Version 2.0, or similar terms that give less certainty about patents, so long as the developers of the source code do not mention that patents apply or might apply to the software in code comments, documentation, or legal notices, and you are not aware of any such patents yourself.

3.  Take these steps within thirty days.

4.  Note that this license does not let you change the license for this software.  Follow [Notices](#notices).

# Excuse

You are excused for unknowingly breaking [Copyleft](#copyleft) if you stop doing anything requiring this license immediately, or if you contribute as required within thirty days of learning you broke the rule.  You are excused for unknowingly breaking [Notices](#notices) if you take all practical steps to comply within thirty days of learning you broke the rule. You and your organisation are excused for unknowingly breaking [Distribution](#distribution) if you desist immediately.

# Patent

Each contributor licenses you to do everything with this software that would otherwise infringe any patent claims they can license or become able to license.

# Reliability

No contributor can revoke this license.

# No Liability

**As far as the law allows, this software comes as is, without any warranty or condition, and no contributor will be liable to anyone for any damages related to this software or this license, under any kind of legal claim.**
